1. retrieve_variants_info_GnomAD.ipynb: all the variant info of the filtered positions of all GPCRs from GNOMAD. 
   Introduce the possible relation with a disease with DisGeNET and impact prediction scores (SIFT, PolyPhen-2) by VEP.

2. analysis_variant_info.ipynb: data analysis of the variant files of each family.

3. Folder /analysis_by_region: store the separated analysis (heatmaps, barplots,...) by region, BS, IBS, CMs.

4. PTM_info: as we have just considered the 'Modified Residue' when retrieving the PTM info in 'retrieve_variants_info_GnomAD_by_classes.ipynb' and we need to add the other types of PTMs (lipidation, glycosylation, etc) we create this new file. This will build a new PTM_IMPACT/PTMs_all.csv and the data will be then added to the 'final' file with all the variant info.

5. Folder remaining2: there were 19 GPCRs that had the ENSG in ch37 and we needed to get the data
